# NIST-RMF-Implementation-for-LemonCorp
### Introduction

This project documents the end-to-end implementation of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) for <a href="https://github.com/ihuoma-ajaero/LemonCorp/blob/main">LemonCorp</a> as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-37 Revision 2. The repository demonstrates how RMF is applied in practice to manage cybersecurity and privacy risk for an information system throughout its lifecycle.

The RMF provides a structured, repeatable process for integrating security, privacy, and risk management activities into system development and operations. Through this project, each RMF step is methodically executed, documented, and supported with artifacts to reflect real-world governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) practices.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

Demonstrate practical knowledge of the NIST Risk Management Framework

Show how RMF is used to identify, assess, mitigate, authorize, and continuously monitor cybersecurity risk

Create hands-on experience showcasing RMF execution suitable for GRC, risk, compliance, and security governance roles

Bridge theoretical RMF guidance with applied documentation and decision-making

### Scope

This project covers all seven steps of the NIST RMF, including:

- Prepare – Establishing organizational and system-level risk context

- Categorize – Determining system impact levels using FIPS 199 & NIST SP 800-60

- Select – Selecting and tailoring security controls from NIST SP 800-53 & sp 800-53B

- Implement – Documenting control implementation details

- Assess – Evaluating control effectiveness using NIST 800-53A

- Authorize – Supporting risk-based authorization decisions

- Monitor – Establishing continuous monitoring activities


The scope includes:

A defined system boundary and system description

Risk-based decision-making aligned with federal standards

Documentation artifacts typically produced during RMF execution

Alignment with supporting NIST publications (e.g., SP 800-53, SP 800-53A, SP 800-30, SP 800-60, SP 800-37)

This project does not involve live production systems or real organizational data. All systems and scenarios are illustrative and created for educational and portfolio purposes.

### Objectives

The key objectives of this project are to:

- Apply RMF concepts step-by-step in a structured and traceable manner

- Demonstrate understanding of control selection, tailoring, and assessment

- Produce RMF artifacts that mirror real compliance and audit documentation

- Show how risk is identified, analyzed, accepted, mitigated, or monitored

- Build a strong, reviewable body of work that reflects readiness for GRC roles

### Expected Outcomes

By the completion of this project, the following outcomes will be achieved:

- A fully documented RMF lifecycle for a defined information system

- Clear mapping between RMF steps and their corresponding artifacts

Demonstrated competency in:

- Risk categorization and impact analysis

- Security control selection and tailoring

- Control assessment and authorization support

- Continuous monitoring strategy development
